## Introduction:

In 2014, the cheapest fare from New York to Vienna was found to be around $800, but according to the advertised fares, where for a select no. of dates, these tickets were between $350 and $450. 

It all seemed to be a good deal and one might wonder if whether it is true or not. The industry does mistake the occasional mistakes on fares, because airlines occasionally and accidentally do happen to post fares that exclude fuel surcharges. Normally, it is expected that the advanced algorithms employed by these airlines would be updating fares that takes into account large number of factors, however due to the order generations of systems in place, mistakes do happen.
