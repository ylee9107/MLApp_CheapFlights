The industry does mistake the occasional mistakes on fares, because airlines occasionally and accidentally do happen to post fares that exclude fuel surcharges. Normally, it is expected that the advanced algorithms employed by these airlines would be updating fares that takes into account large number of factors, however due to the order generations of systems in place, mistakes do happen.\n",
